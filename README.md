# dhl

Querys the tracking page of a delivery service for the status of a sent package.

## Introduction

Get delivery progress.

    var tracking = require('dhl');

    var packet = {
        "service": "dhl",
        "id":      23
    };

    tracking.track(packet, function (tracking) {

        if (tracking.data.arrived === true) {
            console.log("arrived!");
        } else {
            console.log("not yet :(");
        }
    });

## Available delivery services

* dhl
* ups

## Installation
`npm install dhl`

... or to install the package globally:

`npm install -g dhl`

## Using

The version scheme is this:

    {major-release}-{feature-release}-{bugfixes/maintaining}

__MajorÂ­release numbers__ do not change so much. Indeed I have no plans to use some other digit than 1.  
__Feature-release numbers__ change if I introduce new features (e. g. the ups feature pushed dhl to 1.2.0 from 1.1.1).  
__Bugfixes/maintaining numbers__ increment every time I fix or do some maintaining stuff. Nothing is intended to break.  

If you are using dhl as dependency in your module, you have this version options:

* fixed version, e. g. 1.2.0 (very safe, nothing breaks, but you will not get any new stuff)
* describing bugfixes channel, e. g. 1.2.* (safe, nothing should break, bugs will be fixed.)
* bleeding edge channel, e. g. 1.* or even * (not safe, something will break, new bugs)

If you are not sure, use a fixed version.
